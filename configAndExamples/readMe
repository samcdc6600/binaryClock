We get permission denied when running the script
"set_HOME_for_config_testing.sh" with "dot space" syntax. We think this has
something to do with tcsh based what we have read online.

One should run the command found in the aformentioned script to change the HOME
shell variable. Doing this will direct our clock to the file
".config/binClock.conf". This way we can use a test script.
